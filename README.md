# Minimalistic Portfolie Website

This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website, a minimalist representation of my work and interests. 
The colour tone of the design is in the spectrum of black, white and grey, which creates a calm and professional atmosphere.

The design has a modern feel and was developed with special attention to user-friendliness and aesthetics. 
Small, subtle hover effects are scattered throughout the site, adding a dynamic touch to the otherwise plain site.

This is my first project of this kind, where I have tried to demonstrate my skills and creative potential. Every element 
of the page was created with care and attention to detail.

I have also included a small Easteregg. Have fun discovering it! I hope that my website offers you a comprehensive 
insight into my work and me as a person.

Thank you for taking the time to visit and peruse my portfolio. I look forward to your feedback and am open to any 
questions or suggestions you may have.

Happy Coding!
