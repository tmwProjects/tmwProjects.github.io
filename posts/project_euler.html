<h1 id="project-euler">Project Euler</h1>
<p>Today I am happy to share a special treat with you: A Jupyter
notebook full of solved tasks from Project Euler, programmed in Python.
For those of you who don’t know Project Euler yet: It is a collection of
challenging math/programming problems designed to develop logical
thinking and programming skills.</p>
<p>You can launch the notebook directly from Binder or download it from
GitHub to explore it in your own environment. You can find both links below. I look forward to your
feedback and your solutions to the tasks of Project Euler.</p>
