<h2 id="what-is-git-and-github">What is Git and Github?</h2>
<p>Git, launched in 2005, is a complimentary, distributed version
control system that facilitates collaborative work on software projects,
irrespective of the geographical location of the contributors. It offers
the ability for multiple developers to independently integrate their
modifications to the project, log and trace these alterations, and, when
necessary, access previous versions of the project. Being
platform-independent, Git can be utilised across diverse computing
environments.</p>
<p>Contrastingly, GitHub enhances the collaboration process in Git. It
serves as a platform that hosts code repositories in a cloud-based
environment, thus enabling multiple developers to collaboratively engage
with a single project and monitor each other’s modifications in real
time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, GitHub encompasses features for project organization and
management. For instance, tasks can be assigned to specific individuals
or groups, and permissions and roles can be established for
collaborators. Comment moderation is also available to keep all
participants informed of the latest developments. Additionally, GitHub
repositories are publically accessible, encouraging global interaction
among developers. This allows for collective refinement of code, as
developers worldwide can contribute to each other’s work with
modifications and enhancements.</p>
<p>For research, the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en"
title="Github Docs">Docs</a> of Github or the <a
href="https://git-scm.com/doc" title="Git Docs">Docs</a> of Git can be
used. For the workflow, an initial exposure to Git is extremely helpful,
allowing the work processes to be understood concretely. are
understood.</p>

<h2 id="git---local-configuration">Git - Local configuration</h2>
<p>Installation instructions for the respective operating system can be
readily obtained from Google. One of the first steps in using Git in
conjunction with Gibhub is to configure Git on your own computer.</p>
<p>Inside the terminal:</p>
<pre><code>git config --global user.name "Pseudonym/Name"
git config --global user.mail "Mailadress"</code></pre>
<p>Furthermore, extremely complex configurations are possible.</p>
<p><a href="#contents"><strong>Back to content</strong></a></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="create-a-new-repository">Create a new repository</h2>
<p>The initialisation command of Git is necessary for this:</p>
<pre><code>git init</code></pre>
<p>Git then creates a new repository directory in the current directory.
All files required by Git are stored in the subfolder /.git. In UNIX
systems, the dot in front of the folder name indicates that this
directory is hidden.</p>
<p>Git stores the corresponding versions of the programme we are working
on in .git so that we can subsequently track how we have changed our
programme.</p>
<p>Example: I want to create a repository called
<strong>program</strong>.</p>
<p>I create a directory called <strong>program</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>mkdir /home/user/program</code></pre>
<p>I then change to the appropriate directory and create the appropriate
repository using Git’s initialisation command:</p>
<pre><code>cd /home/user/program</code></pre>
<pre><code>git init</code></pre>
<p>If you change to the appropriate /.git directory and run the ls
command, you will get the following output:</p>
<pre><code>branches  config  description  HEAD  

hooks  info  objects  refs
</code></pre>
<p>The folder /.git contains various subfolders, which we won’t be doing
much with at the moment, as Git automatically manages all versions.</p>
<p><a href="#contents"><strong>Back to content</strong></a></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="working-with-git">Working with git</h2>
<p>The following will be about understanding how the different versions
are managed within a project and what nutritional value git offers for
one’s own workflow. Many IDEAs facilitate working with Git in connection
with Github. However, it is also necessary here to understand what is
actually used how and above all why within the IDEA. Here, everyone is
free to do version management relatively automatically or manually.</p>
<p>In the following, we will first introduce version management with
Git. It should be noted that we will work exclusively locally. This
means that all changes and subsequent work will be done exclusively on
our own computer and nothing will be put online.</p>
<p><a href="#contents"><strong>Back to content</strong></a></p>
<h3 id="git-add---bridge-between-working-directory-and-staging-area">git
add - Bridge between working directory and staging area</h3>
<p>With a <strong>commit</strong>, the state of a projechttps://github.com/tmwProjects/Blog/blob/master/content/t is saved at
the corresponding time where the command was listed. Here, a commit
corresponds to a version of the project, so to speak.</p>
<p>It is important to understand here that with a commit, the state of a
project or a specific file in our <strong>working directory</strong> is
transferred from the project to the so-called <strong>staging
area</strong>. A commit is first prepared in the staging area with the
following command:</p>
<p>For single file:</p>
<pre><code>git add [FILE]</code></pre>
<p>For entire folders:</p>
<pre><code>git add [FOLDER]</code></pre>
<p>After we have marked the corresponding files/folders with the command
in the staging area, we could execute a commit directly. First, however,
an important note:</p>
<p>Assuming we would continue to write our programme in our working
directory after committing to the staging area, the changes we have made
would not be adopted by the version stored in the staging area. For
this, we would have to execute the git add command again.</p>
<p>Here it can be helpful to imagine several working levels:</p>

</figure>
<p><a href="#contents"><strong>Back to content</strong></a></p>
<h3 id="git-commit---bridge-between-staging-area-and-repository">git
commit - Bridge between staging area and repository</h3>
<p>Since we have stored the current version of our programme in the
staging area, we should switch to storing the current version in our
repository from our staging area. This can be done by using the
following command in the terminal:</p>
<pre><code>git commit -m "message"</code></pre>https://github.com/tmwProjects/Blog/blob/master/content/
<p>This command creates a new commit from all the staged changes. When
committing, it is necessary to store a commit message. For a better
overview, it is helpful to store in the commit message what was
specifically changed. Short and concise is the appropriate home remedy
for the first line. This is followed by an empty line and then a small,
more concrete description.</p>
<p>For this purpose, the parameter -m is used in connection with the
message in the inverted commas. If a commit was carried out, a concrete
<strong>commit ID</strong> is attributed to this commit. This is
important when it comes to the work history of the repository.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that one atomic change per commit should be used
to maintain the clarity of the repository.</p>
<p>Here are two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>One commit per bug</li>
<li>One commit per feature</li>
</ul>
<p>If the commit command was used without the <strong>-m</strong>
parameter, Git will prompt you to put a message in a text file. If this
doesn’t happen, for example because you don’t leave a message, the
commit command will be aborted.</p>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>: If a programming project is growing and other
programmers from all over the world may be working on your project, it
would be advisable to leave all commit messages in English.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="good-practice-for-commit-messages">Good practice for commit
messages <br></h4>
<p><strong>Short and concise</strong>: The first line of the commit
should be a brief summary of the changes. It is often recommended that
this line should not exceed 50 characters. <br><br> <strong>Imperative
form</strong>: Commit messages should be written in the imperative form,
for example “Fix bug” instead of “Fixed bug” or “Fixes bug”. This
convention is followed by Git itself in its automatically generated
messages, such as “Merge pull request #123 from branch”. <br><br>
<strong>Detail in body</strong>: If the changes require more context or
explanation, these should be written in the body of the commit. This
should follow the summary line and after a blank line. It is often
recommended that each line in the body should contain no more than 72
characters. <br><br> <strong>What and Why</strong>: It can be helpful to
describe not only what has been changed, but also the reason for the
change. This can be particularly useful when fixing bugs or making
complex changes. <br><br> <strong>Reference resources</strong>: If your
change references an issue or bug report, you should reference it in
your commit message. Some teams use certain conventions for this, such
as adding “Fixes #123” to the end of the commit message to close the
issue, which is listed as number 123 in their issue tracking system.
<br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>following</strong> parameter is useful if you have
committed something and later find out that what you committed doesn’t
really work. Then the original commit gets a new commit ID. This way,
you don’t have to do another commit.</p>
<p>To change a commit, use the following command in the terminal:</p>
<pre><code>git commit --amend</code></pre>
<p>This will ensure that the latest changes from your <strong>working
directory</strong> are included in the <strong>staging
area</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: This rewrites the log from the
repository. More precisely, the last commit is overwritten. Ideally, you
should only use this command locally on your computer.</p>
<p>This becomes important when several people are working on a
repository. Confusion can arise because not all people working on the
repository have the same version on their computer.</p>
<p><a href="#contents"><strong>Back to content</strong></a></p>
<h3 id="git-log---history-of-the-commits">git log - History of the
commits</h3>
<p>This command allows you to display the individual changes to your
repository. An individual commit is clearly identified by its SHA I
hash. These hashes are created on the basis of the corresponding commit
so that no two commits can have the same checksums.</p>
<p>To do this, use the following command in the terminal:</p>
<pre><code>git log</code></pre>
<p>The order of the commit history is such that the oldest change is
shown at the bottom and the most recent at the top. You are shown the
individual commits, including the corresponding checksums, author’s
name, time and, last but not least, your commit message. It is important
to note here that the most recent commit is referred to as
<strong>HEAD</strong>.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>commit 0fc55f28f09d4590c20422608bb58e7c8c3c307f (HEAD -&gt; master, origin/master, origin/HEAD)

Author: jbloggs &lt;jane.bloggs@protonmail.com&gt;
Date:   Tue Jul 13 15:28:19 2021 +0200</code></pre>
<p>If we look at the history of the repository, we see a history with
different hash values. The last commit is referred to here as HEAD. HEAD
here means the most recent commit checked out.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>0fc55f2 (HEAD -&gt; master, origin/master, origin/HEAD) Changes
0d3407f Changes
f759623 Changes
f3a0db4 Changes
82b182b Update README.md
d02ccb6 Add files via upload
0df2ffe Create README.md
32e5dca Initial commit</code></pre>
<p>We see here a series of commits with corresponding abbreviations of
the hash values and the <strong>HEAD</strong> commit. If we look at the
commits from top to bottom, the second commit (calculated from
<strong>HEAD</strong>) is correspondingly the second to last commit.
This can be identified not only with its checksum, but also as
<strong>HEAD~1</strong>. This is the parent of the <strong>HEAD</strong>
commit. The third commit is then <strong>HEAD<sub>2<strong>, the fourth
commit is </strong>HEAD</sub>3</strong>, etc.</p>
<p>These names can also be used instead of the hash values of the
individual commits. This makes it a little more convenient to work
with.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>git diff f759623 HEAD</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>git diff HEAD~1 HEAD</code></pre>
<p>Another important parameter for the command is <strong>-p</strong>.
This displays significantly more information for the comhttps://github.com/tmwProjects/Blog/blob/master/content/mits, such as
which lines within the code specifically added or removed. If the commit
needs to be displayed in less detail, the following parameter can be
used:</p>
<pre><code>git log --oneline</code></pre>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>0fc55f2 (HEAD -&gt; master, origin/master, origin/HEAD) Changes
0d3407f Changes
f759623 Changes
f3a0db4 Changes
82b182b Update README.md
d02ccb6 Add files via upload
0df2ffe Create README.md

<h3 id="git-diff---show-differences">git diff - Show differences</h3>
<p>This command is useful if you are working within your working
directory, but you are not sure which changes have already been applied
to your staging area. With the following command, you can see the
relative changes between the working directory and the staging area:</p>
<pre><code>git diff</code></pre>
<p>To see the relative changes between the staging area and the
repository, use the <strong>–cached</strong> parameter.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>git diff --cached</code></pre>
<p>If you want to see specific differences between two individual
commits, you need the commit IDs of the two commits and the following
command:</p>
<pre><code>git diff [hash1] [hash2]</code></pre>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>git diff 0d3407f f3a0db4</code></pre>
<pre><code>git diff 0d3407f f3a0db4

diff --git a/Program/program.py b/Program/program.py
index 12b063f..4a669d8 100755
--- a/Program/program.py
+++ b/Program/program.py
@@ -1,7 +1,5 @@
 #!/usr/bin/env python</code></pre>
<p>The variables <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> in front of
the individual versions do <strong>not</strong> refer to concrete
folders or directories, but to the corresponding versions that we put
into relation.</p>
<p>The following output:</p>
<pre><code>@@ -1,7 +1,5 @@</code></pre>
<p>means that in the first file the <strong>first line</strong> has been
deleted and a total of <strong>seven lines</strong> are output,
therefore <strong>-1.7</strong>. Subsequently, with the second file, one
is added to the <strong>first line</strong> and a total of <strong>five
lines</strong> are output, therefore +1.5</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: If the command <strong>git diff
–cached</strong> does not produce any output, it is probably because no
concrete changes were made in the staging area.</p>
<p>It is quite possible that the comparison will show you changes that
may not be correct. This is probably because git assumes what changes
need to be made to get from hash1 to hash2. Therefore, it is important
to store the hash values from old to young.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Whoever commits <strong>first</strong> should
also be named <strong>first</strong>.</p>
<p>In the simple case that we look at the changes of commits in relation
to a single file, then it becomes quite clear. However, it is often the
case that within a project there are several files that are changed
within one commit. Then, of course, you will see a lot of changes. In
order to be able to differentiate this somewhat, use the following
important parameter to view the changes of a specific file:</p>
<pre><code>git diff [hash1] [hash2] -- [dataname]</code></pre>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>git diff 0d3407f f3a0db4 -- program.py</code></pre>
<p>Note: The <strong>– [dataname]</strong> parameter can be used with
all the git commands presented, such as git log. It is also possible to
view changes to specific file formats or filenames. A proxy can be used
for this.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>git log -- *.py</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>git log -- program.*</code></pre>
<p><a href="#contents"><strong>Back to content</strong></a></p>
<h3 id="git-reset---revert-changes">Git reset - revert changes</h3>
<p>Here we can remove <strong>all</strong> changes from the
<strong>staging-area</strong>. The prerequisite for this command is that
changes are stored in the staging area at all.For this we use the
following command:</p>
<pre><code>git reset</code></pre>
<p>If it is a question of removing <strong>specific</strong> changes,
such as from a specific file, then the following command can be used in
conjunction with the corresponding file parameter in the terminal:</p>
<pre><code>git reset [filename]</code></pre>
<p>But not only all changes marked for a commit can be undone, but also
changes that refer specifically to a commit. The following command is
responsible for this:</p>
<pre><code>git reset [commit hash]</code></pre>
<p>Here, all changes in the workind directory remain, but all commits
<strong>after</strong> the commit with the specified commit hash are
deleted. This means that all changes that have already been committed to
the repository with the corresponding commits are returned to the
working directory after the above command.</p>
<figure>
<img
src="grafics/gitreset.jpg"
alt="reset" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">reset</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Another important parameter, but one that should be used with
caution, is the <strong>–hard</strong> parameter. Here, all commits are
also deleted after the corresponding commit hash. The difference to the
previous command is that <strong>all</strong> changes are
<strong>discarded</strong>. To do this, use the following command in the
terminal:</p>
<pre><code>git reset --hard [commit hash]</code></pre>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: When working with the git reset command,
you must be careful, because this command can cause significant data
loss. Do not use this command when working with remote repositories,
such as Github. These repositories are often shared with other people
and this command automatically changes the git history. If in doubt,
always tend to <strong>not</strong> use the command.</p>
<p>The parameter <strong>–hard</strong> can also be used in other ways.
Assuming there are correct changes in your repository and you want to
continue working on your programme based on this current repository. If
you are working in your working directory and unfortunately find that
your changes have led you astray, you can use the following command to
overwrite your current working directory with the current repository
(MASTER):</p>
<pre><code>git reset --hard</code></pre>
<p>But here too, make sure you know what data is in your working
directory before you execute the command. This can lead to immense data
loss.</p>
<p><a href="#contents"><strong>Back to content</strong></a></p>
<h3 id="git-checkout---jump-to-a-commit">Git checkout - Jump to a
commit</h3>
<p>The <strong>git checkout</strong> command restores the state of a
given commit. Then the current working directory is in the state it was
in at the specified commit hash. You can view files, compile the
project, run tests and even edit files without fear of losing the
current project state. None of your actions and changes are saved in the
repository.</p>
<p>Type the following command in the terminal:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout [hash]</code></pre>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: Git tries to make local changes here,
which can lead to conflicts. Only use this command if your working
directory is empty or has no changes.</p>
<p>With the git checkout command, we can check out a previous commit and
return the repository to the status. Checking out a particular commit
puts the repository into a state with the HEAD detached. In the detached
state, all newly made commits are orphaned as soon as you return to an
established branch. Orphaned commits are deleted by Git during the next
purge. The purge occurs at configured intervals and removes orphaned
commits permanently. To prevent orphaned commits from falling victim to
garbage collection, we need to make sure that we are in a branch.</p>
<p>Once you have finished working on a particular commit, you can jump
back to the original version of your project with the following
command:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout master</code></pre>
<p><a href="#contents"><strong>Back to content</strong></a></p>
<h3 id="git-stash---cache-changes">Git stash - cache changes</h3>
<p>In case you want to see the status of your project from a few weeks
ago, but you still have changes in your current working directory and/or
staging area, you can use the command to display the status from that
point in time without losing the current changes. You can use the
following command to cache your current changes:</p>
<pre><code>git stash</code></pre>
<p>In short, git stash allows you to cache the current changes in your
working directory and staging area.</p>
<p>Workflow example:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>You save the current state in the stash.</li>
<li>Look at the past commit.</li>
<li>Switch back to the current state.</li>
<li>Read the old state from the stash.</li>
</ol>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Saved working directory and index state
&quot;WIP on master: 016c048 Create index file&quot;.
HEAD is now at 016c048 Create index file
(To restore them type &quot;git stash apply&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Following this, you can use the previously introduced <strong>git
status</strong> command to see that your current working directory is
cleaned up:</p>
<pre><code># On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean</code></pre>
<p>The last saved stash always has the smallest room on the list, as if
you were always adding another package to a stack. With the following
command you can look at all cached stashes:</p>
<pre><code>git stash list</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>stash@{0}: WIP on master: 016c048 Create file
stash@{1}: WIP on master: a1370d1 Revert
stash@{2}: WIP on master: 1cd6015 Change numbers</code></pre>
<p>With the parameter <strong>pop</strong>, you can always restore the
last saved stash. What is meant is that with the command</p>
<pre><code>git stash pop</code></pre>
<p><strong>stash@{0}</strong> is restored first, followed by
<strong>stash@{1}</strong> and then <strong>stash@{2}</strong>.</p>
<p>You also have the option of using the already introduced command
<strong>git diff</strong> to compare the current stash with what is in
your current working directory. With the stash command and the
previously introduced commands, you have creative ways to jump between
versions and changes without having to worry about losing recent
changes.</p>
<p><a href="#contents"><strong>Back to content</strong></a></p>
<h3 id="git-revert---undo-changes-other-way">Git revert - Undo changes
(Other way)</h3>
<p>Here I would like to introduce a command that also reverts changes,
but in a slightly different way. Here, a new commit is created that
reverts the corresponding changes. You have the option of changing a
commit afterwards, as described above. This was done, for example, with
the command <strong>git commit –amend</strong>, but this only worked as
long as the repository was local. Here Git offers you the option of
making a new commit that undoes all the changes made to an existing
one.</p>
<pre><code>git revert [Commit Hash]</code></pre>
<p>Instead of removing the commit from the project history, it
determines how to reverse changes caused by the commit. A new commit is
then added with the corresponding reversed content. This prevents Git’s
history from being truncated, which is important for the integrity of
your commit history and for reliable collaboration.</p>
<p>When the command is executed, a commit is created as described, which
must also contain a corresponding commit message. In this particular
case, this commit message is generated auhttps://github.com/tmwProjects/Blog/blob/master/content/tomatically. This makes sense
in so far as it may not even be marked in the repository history that
this is a revert.</p>
<figure>
<img
src="grafics/gitrevert.jpg"
alt="revert" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">revert</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You should use this undo command when you want to reverse a commit
from your project history. This can be useful, for example, if it turns
out that a bug was introduced into the project by a very specific
commit. Instead of manually navigating to the code in question, fixing
it and committing a new snapshot, you can use git revert to do the whole
process automatically.</p>
<p>A revert has two important advantages over a reset. First, the
project history remains unaffected: The process has no effect on commits
that have already been published in a shared repository. Second, you can
apply git revert to individual commits at any point in the history. git
reset, on the other hand, only works retroactively from the current
commit.</p>
<p>The advantage of using revert is that a new commit is created to undo
certain changes. This way, no commits are deleted from the commit
history or orphaned. git revert is the safer option compared to git
reset in terms of losing code.</p>

<h3 id="git-blame">Git blame</h3>
<p>With this command you can display changes to a file. It shows line by
line in which commit it was last changed.</p>
<pre><code>git blame [filename]</code></pre>
<p>To make working in the terminal more comfortable and to keep an
overview, you can also use the following command to highlight the same
commits in colour:</p>
<pre><code>git blame --colour-lines [filename]</code></pre>

<p>This can be helpful when working with several people and you want to
make sure that if there is a bug, for example, that you write to the
right person about it.</p>
<p>For more detailed handling of the <strong>git blame</strong> command,
use the following command in the terminal:</p>
<pre><code>git blame --help</code></pre>
<p><a href="#contents"><strong>Back to content</strong></a></p>
<h3 id="gitignore-data">.gitignore-Data</h3>
<p>With the so-called gitignore you can have files ignored. The file
.gitignore contains a list of paths that are ignored by git. Here,
changes to this data will have no effect on the commands <strong>git
diff</strong>, <strong>git add</strong>, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: The .gitignore file should always be
committed so that certain files, folders, etc. are not included in the
shared repository in the first place. This can also be very important
when working together in a larger team.</p>
<p>Create a file called .gitignore inside your working directory as
follows:</p>
<pre><code>nano .gitignore</code></pre>
<p>Example of the content of a .gitignore file:</p>

#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don&#39;t work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
#Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   commonly ignored for libraries.
